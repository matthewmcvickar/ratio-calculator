# Alfred Ratio Calculator

Need to find the missing value in a ratio? This Alfred script will help you do that quickly.

Invoke the plugin with `rat` and feed it a ratio equation in plain text delimited by spaces with a `?` or `x` in place of the missing value.

For example: To solve for x in 2/4 = x/10:

  ```
  2 4 x 10
  ```

Alfred will then return `5`.
